# Welcome to My Portfolio

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, where I showcase some of my most notable projects. Below, you’ll find instructions on how to run each program. Feel free to explore the source code, and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at jmcrist2@ncsu.edu.

## p2: System Test Organizer

This program is a versatile system test organizer that I’ve used extensively to test various projects. It allows users to create system tests and efficiently track their program’s tests.

 ### How to Run:

	1.	Navigate to the p2 folder.
	2.	Double-click BlackBoxTestSystem.jar to launch the program.
	3.	Explore the features to create and manage your system tests.

## Wolf Scheduler

Wolf Scheduler is a scheduling assistant designed to help students plan their semesters. It works best with a course list, and I’ve provided several test files to simulate a typical course selection process.

### How to Run:

	1.	Navigate to the wolf_scheduler folder.
	2.	Unzip WolfScheduler.zip.
	3.	Open the unzipped folder and double-click WolfScheduler.jar.
	4.	Choose a course file (e.g., actual_course_records.txt) to begin scheduling your courses.

## Product Backlog

This program helps track tasks for a team’s product. It allows you to create a product and then add, edit, or remove tasks. While it’s currently in a basic state, I plan to expand it to enable status exporting and importing for team collaboration.

### How to Run:

	1.	Navigate to the product_backlog folder.
	2.	Double-click ProductBacklog.jar to launch the application.
	3.	Add a product and manage its tasks as needed.
